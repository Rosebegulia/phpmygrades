What is phpmygrades?
--------------------
phpmygrades uses a combination of PHP and SQL to store grades (as well as small communication forums) for a school.


What are you doing with it?
---------------------------
This was originally developed many years ago (around 2004) for a high school project.  Although I would like to bring it up to modern,
usable standards, my interests have shifted incredibly and it's highly unlikely I'll work on it again.

Nonetheless, I maintain the code here for posterity's sake.


Can I help?
------------
Sure!  If you really desire to bring it up to date, you have my full blessing.  However, I truly feel a better base could be found in
other software.
