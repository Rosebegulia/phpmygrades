What is phpmygrades?
--------------------
phpmygrades uses a combination of PHP and SQL to store grades (as well as small communication forums) for a school.


What are you doing with it?
---------------------------
This was originally developed many years ago for a school project.  Currently, I hope the experience and wisdom I've gained over the years will help this become better than ever!
My thoughts for its growth can be found in the TODO file.


Can I help?
------------
Sure!  If you have any suggestions, feel free to email them to me at <borismalcov [at] users [dot] sf [dot] net>.
Alternatively, if you're handy with code, feel free to merge changes with this github.
