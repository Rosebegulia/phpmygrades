Basic Instructions
-------------------
1.  Make a backup of your config.php file (just in case).  You may also 
want to make a backup of your SQL database.
2.  Overwrite all the old files with the new ones.
3.  Run upgrade.php (through a web browser, or whatever).  It'll tell 
you if you need to do anything else (like manually update config.php).
4.  Login as admin (if you already aren't) and go to your options page.  
Make sure every option is the way you want it to be (because options may 
have been added), and save your options.
4.  Your release should be upgraded; contact me if something doesn't 
work correctly for you.

0.1.1 - 0.1.2
--------------
The ability to assign categories to assignments has been added.  Because 
of this, teachers should go back and assign old assignments a category.  
(The averaging function won't work without doing so.)

0.1.0 - 0.1.1
--------------
Just following the basic instructions should work for this release.
