To install phpmygrades  |
-------------------------
1.  Download a copy of the latest code (in whichever format you'd like) 
from the files page 
(http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=140425). 
2.  Decompress (and unarchive, if necessary) the file to a web 
directory. If you can, give the web server write access to the include/ directory 
under this directory. 
3.  Create a database, along with a username and password combination 
that may access it, for phpmygrades. 
4.  Open a web browser, and go to 
http://your-web-server/wherever-phpmygrades-is-installed/install.php. 
5.  Fill out all applicable fields, and click "Install." 
6.  If the web server does not have write access to the directory, you 
will need to manually create config.php and fill it with the information that 
should be presented to you. 
7.  Delete install.php (which isn't needed, since the installer sees if 
an installion is already present before continuing, but is recommended 
anyway). You can also delete upgrade.php, if it's present. 
8.  Go to the main page (http://your-web-server/phpmygrades/index.php) 
and login with your admin username and password.
9.  Go to the options page and make sure every setting is correct.  Save 
when finished.

-------------------------
To upgrade phpmygrades  |
-------------------------
1.  make a backup of your current database, just in case something goes 
wrong. It is also wise to make a backup of include/config.php. 
read any release notes (which will come with the new distribution) and 
2.  follow any special instructions. Otherwise: 
3.  replace the old files with the new ones 
4.  run update.php 
5.  go to your options page (as an administrator) and make sure all 
fields are filled out correctly (several may have been added). Once finished, 
go to save.
